# WorkerManager - A tool to manage workers üë®‚Äçüè≠

This app can help save some time & paper, by letting anyone manage some important data of workers. Like - Daily wages, monthly payments, advance payments, attendance, leaves etc. I built this cool app when I was learning android, as a freelance developer. This app was built for a builder, who was already facing these issues. But hey don't worry, this code is completely owned by me. So, feel free to fork, modify & use this repository as per your needs üòâ
